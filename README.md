# Analysis of Bank of Canada Note Series

This repository contains some exploration of the Canadian Bank notes in circulation from 1998 through 2021. The work is my own. The work supplements a working paper I have with the Bank.

The note series data is available for download from the Bank's website. The weekly and month-end series are https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/banking-and-financial-statistics/bank-of-canada-assets-and-liabilities-weekly-formerly-b2/ and https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/banking-and-financial-statistics/bank-of-canada-assets-and-liabilities-month-end-formerly-b1/ respectively. The population, GDP and CPI data are all publicly available for download from the StatCan website. The data on CAD FX is available from the Bank of Canada website.
